# FlashingtheBeehive

# This tutorial is designed to explain how to flash IC4 on the module (STM32F373CCT6, Cortex M4), and will work on other similar modules using these chips in the Mutable Instruments family, and perhaps others. Other tutorials are available, but this one tries to add more detailed information and links all in one place.
